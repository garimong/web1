  Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight
  So watch me bring the fire
  and set the night alight
  <br><br>Shoes on get up in the morn
  Cup of milk let's rock and roll
  King Kong kick the drum
  rolling on like a rolling stone
  Sing song when I'm walking home
  Jump up to the top LeBron
  Ding dong call me on my phone
  Ice tea and a game of ping pong
  <br><br>This is getting heavy
  Can you hear the bass boom, I'm ready
  Life is sweet as honey
  Yeah this beat cha ching like money
  Disco overload I'm into that
  I'm good to go
  I'm diamond you know I glow up
  Hey, so let's go
  <br><br>Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight
  So watch me bring the fire
  and set the night alight
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
  <br><br>Bring a friend join the crowd
  Whoever wanna come along
  Word up talk the talk
  just move like we off the wall
  Day or night the sky's alight
  So we dance to the break of dawn
  Ladies and gentlemen,
  I got the medicine
  so you should keep ya
  eyes on the ball, huh
  <br><br>This is getting heavy
  Can you hear the bass boom, I'm ready
  Life is sweet as honey
  Yeah this beat cha ching like money
  Disco overload I'm into that
  I'm good to go
  I'm diamond you know I glow up
  Let's go
  <br><br>Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight
  So watch me bring the fire
  and set the night alight
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
  <br><br>Dynnnnnanana, life is dynamite
  Dynnnnnanana, life is dynamite
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
  <br><br>Dynnnnnanana eh
  Dynnnnnanana eh
  Dynnnnnanana eh
  Light it up like dynamite
  <br><br>Dynnnnnanana eh
  Dynnnnnanana eh
  Dynnnnnanana eh
  Light it up like dynamite
  <br><br>Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight
  So watch me bring the fire
  and set the night alight
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite
  <br><br>Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight
  So watch me bring the fire
  and set the night alight
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
  <br><br>Dynnnnnanana, life is dynamite
  Dynnnnnanana, life is dynamite
  Shining through the city
  with a little funk and soul
  So I'mma light it up like dynamite, woah
